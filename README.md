## About the Video Course
Once upon a time, JavaScript could only be used for simple form validators. Well, time has changed and if you’re a web designer or developer, chances are that your next big project requires a cutting edge web application framework that offers state of the art features such as a Virtual DOM, Reactivity, Superhero performance, all with a feather light footprint. That is where Vue JS comes in. Vue JS is an amazing JavaScript framework for building high performance user interfaces but has enough ammo to power your next killer web application. In this beginner’s course on VueJS, we will go from the absolute basics of a framework, including concepts such as DOM and setting up a development environment, to understanding core Vue features, essential workflows and best practices. You will work through 20+ hands-on exercises to solidify your command on essential Vue concepts. Vue offers the best of Angular and React and features a component based architecture that lets you break down your app or even an interface into manageable and scalable functional units. VueJS apps offer incredible performance that is neck to neck and even better than some of the leading web app frameworks in use today. Vue features a Virtual DOM that is lighter than the rest and delivers impeccable performance. If you’re a web designer, developer or even a project manager with a goal to master or pick a web application framework for your project, but are too afraid to begin, then this is your chance to finally realize your dream. Vue is surprisingly simple to learn, which makes it a winner and enables existing production grade projects and teams to incrementally bring it into their ecosystem.
